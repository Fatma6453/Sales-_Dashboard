### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the total sales for the year 2004 in the EMEA territory?
- What is the percentage distribution of sales by deal size (medium, small, large)?
- Which deal size category has the highest percentage of sales?
- What are the top 5 customers based on total sales?
- What is the total sales for the customer "Euro Shopping Channel"?
- What is the total sales for the customer "Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd."?
- What is the total sales for the customer "La Rochelle Gifts"?


### Results
Total Sales Trend: The total sales have shown a consistent increase from 2003 to 2005, with the highest sales recorded in 2004.

Regional Sales Performance: The EMEA region has consistently outperformed the NA region in terms of total sales.

Deal Size Contribution: The medium deal size category has the highest contribution to total sales, followed by small and large deal sizes.

Top Customers: The top 5 customers based on total sales are Euro Shopping Channel, Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd., Australian Collectors Co., Muscle Machine Inc., and La Rochelle Gifts.

### Recommdations 

Focus on High-Performing Regions: Allocate more resources and marketing efforts towards the EMEA region, as it has consistently shown strong sales performance. Identify the factors contributing to its success and replicate them in other regions.

Analyze Deal Size Dynamics: Dive deeper into the medium deal size category to understand the drivers of its high contribution to total sales. Explore potential strategies to increase sales in the small and large deal size categories.

Customer Relationship Management: Develop strategies to retain and grow the business with the top 5 customers. Offer personalized experiences, loyalty programs, or exclusive promotions to strengthen the relationships and increase their sales contribution.

Yearly Sales Forecasting: Use the sales data from previous years to forecast sales for future years. Identify any patterns or seasonality in sales and adjust marketing and sales strategies accordingly.

Market Expansion: Consider exploring opportunities in the APAC region, particularly in Japan, which is currently not represented in the top 5 customers. Conduct market research to understand the potential demand and adapt the product offering to cater to that market
